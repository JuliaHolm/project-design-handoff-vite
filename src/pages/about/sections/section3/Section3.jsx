          During the last decade I have worked in the mystical realm of
          spiritual creative entrepreneurship and have more than 1000 hrs of
          guiding humans to their intuition with meditation, private
          mentorships, cyclic awareness, Akashic Records and Kundalini Yoga.

          I have also built different feminine creative projects, Pop Up shops,
          webshops, websites, decorated shop windows and so much more fun.
